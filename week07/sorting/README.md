# Sorting

## Lets implement two of the fastest sorting algorithms

### Implement Quick Sort

Lets implement quick sort choosing random pivot. 

### Implement Merge Sort

Lets implement classical merge sort.

### Enchance the Merge Sort

Although it is very fast, Merge sort can be made a bit faster.
It does not make sense to keep slicing the array into smaller ones below a given thershold lets say 32.

We can use insertion sort for arrays smaller than 32.

## Exercise Comparator and Comparable

Create a class Student that has First, Third name and grade.
The Student class should implement the Comparable interface.

Create a list of students and sort them according to their names using the compare to method.

Create a list of students and sort them according to their grades using a custom Comparator class.
