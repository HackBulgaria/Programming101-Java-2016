# Sorting

Sorting a sequence of elements is a well-known problem with many solutions.
We could learn a lot just by looking at the steps that different algorithms
take to produce a solution.

## Merge sort

[Merge sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) is a nice way of sorting
a sequence of elements. It is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the
problem in smaller parts, solves them separately and then combines the solutions
to produce a result.

you can find a nice visualization of the steps of the algorithm.

## Quick sort

The name speaks for itself. [Quick sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
is one of the fastest ways for sorting a sequence of arbitrary elements known to
mankind.
