## Map

### Implement your own HashMap

It should use separate chaining for collision resolution.

It should have the following methods:

-put(K key, V value)

-get(K key)

-remove(K key)

-containsKey(K key)

Create an interface for the data structure you will use at each bucket.

When done, play around with the load factor and the data structure you use to see how the performance of your HashMap changes.
