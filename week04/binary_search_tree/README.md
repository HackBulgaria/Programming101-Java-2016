## Binary search

### Implement binary search

First lets implement a classical binary search.

After you have made and tested your implementation lets make some modifications:

-upperBound() using the same approach it should return the index of the first element that is bigger than the provided one.

-lowerBound() using the same approach it should return the index of the first element that is smaller than the provided one.

-interpolationSearch() lets change the condition to determine the middle element using the formulae from the materials for interpolation.

### Implement binary search tree

Lets make our own binary search tree.
It should have the following functions:

-insert(T element)
-remove(T element)
-find(T element)

### Check if two binary trees are equal

Hint: You can use depth first traversal.

### Sort an array using binary search tree

Lets sort an array using our shiny binary search tree.
After building the tree traverse it to create the sorted array.
