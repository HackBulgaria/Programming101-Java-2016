# Conway's Game of Life

Your task today is to implement Conway's game of life while pair programming with a friend.

The restrictions are:
 * For the first hour one of you writes code and the other one stands by and helps
 * After the first hour you should delete all the code that you've written and you should switch roles for the next hour.
 * Work in a plane of atleast 15x15
 * Let it be an infinite cycle
 * Input the places of the cells with life in them as coordinates and show the output in the console using full and empty utf rectangles (you can find them in google)
