First Problems
========================

Code the solutions to the following problems:


1. Is a given number odd
----------------
Check if a given number is Odd or not
```boolean isNumberOdd(int number)
```


2. Is a number prime
----------------
Check if a given number is prime
```boolean isNumberPrime(int number)
```

3. Factorial Digits
----------------
Implement a function , that takes an integer and returns the sum of the factorials of each digit of n.

For example, if number is equal to 145, we want the sum of 1! + 4! + 5!

```int factorialDigits(int number)
```

4. Fibonacci sequence
----------------
Implement a function, which takes an integer n and returns a number, which is formed by concatenating the first n Fibonacci numbers.

For example, if n = 3, the result must be 112.
```int fibonacciSequence(int number)
```


5. Is a given number palindrome
----------------
Implement a function, which takes an integer number and checks if the given number is palindrome.

For example, the integer 121 is palindrome, but 12340321 - not!
```boolean isPalindrome(int number)
```

6. Reverse the odd words in string
----------------
Implement a function, which takes a string and returns a string object containing reversed only the odd words

For example, "This is the first lecture for Programming 101 with Java" is the input.
The result must be: "This si the tsrif lecture rof Programming 101 with avaJ"
```String reverseOddWords(String sentence)
```

7. Get palindrome length
----------------
You need to implement a function, which takes a string and returns an integer of the length of the palindrome
```int getPalindromeLength(String input)
```

Example : `getPalindromeLength("taz*zad") => 2`


8. Check the sum of number and reversedNumber is palindrome
----------------
Write a function, which takes a number and returns boolean if the sum of the number and it's reversed number is palindrome.
```boolean isSumPalindrome(int input)
```

Example: `isSumPalindrome(123) => True`
123 + 321 = 444

9. Find the sum of the divisors in array from numberA to numberB
----------------
Implement a function, which takes two integer numbers and returns the sum of the divisors from each number in the sequence from numberA to numberB
```int sumOfDivisors(int numberA, numberB)
```

Example: `sumOfDivisors(4, 7) => 30`
Divisors of 4: 4, 2, 1
Divisors of 5: 5, 1
Divisors of 6: 6, 3, 2, 1
Divisors of 7: 7, 1
Result = 30

10. Check the number of vowels, consonants and digits in string
----------------
Implement a function, which takes a string sentence and returns the number of the vowels, consonants and numbers in the given string object.
```String [] vowelsConsonantsDigits(String sentence)
```
Example: `vowelsConsonantsDigits("It is 18th of Oct 2016") => ["Vowels: 4", "Consonants: 7", "Digits: 6"]`


Tricky Problems
========================
The explanation of those tasks is in different file.
1. Gas station

2. Check if a given year is leap

3. Build a matrix with the squares of the numbers
